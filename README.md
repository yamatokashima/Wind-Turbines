# Wind-Turbines
### Worked a 3-day data sprint analysis project with 3 colleagues on the wind turbine market to make recommendations on funding turbine operators and manufacturers

Datasets, visuals, SQL Queries, Python code, data dictionaries, and Tableau file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G97DGgpxNxm5d6_BFekW-tmbM5GpSQeX?usp=sharing)

As a team of four, we were held responsible for analyzing data and following up on the following prompts to help stakeholders make decisions on investing in the wind turbine market:

* I want to understand the global energy market and what part wind turbines play within it
  - Place of wind power in the global energy market
  - Growth of wind power over recent years, both globally and in the USA
  - Number of operators in the Wind Turbine market in the USA
  - Onshore vs offshore wind turbines
  - Profitability of the industry
  - Types of power plants being built (S-M-L)
  - Future trends (COP26, IPCC) and regulations for the industry (e.g. more offshore may be allowed...?)
  - Trends over time can be found in the spreadsheet at the bottom of the Land-Based Wind Market Report 
* I want to better understand any environmental issues with building wind turbines
  - Wild life or airplane obstructions
* I want to know who owns which plants (and their turbines) across the USA, so I can assess the footprint of turbine owners in the USA
  - Owners (operators) of wind turbines in the USA
  - Wind energy generation per owner
  - Identify potential companies to approach to fund
* I want to know who operates the wind turbines in the USA, and also whether they operate other types of power plants, so I can assess potential takeover targets
  - Owners (operators) of wind turbines in the USA
  - Wind energy generation per owner
  - Which other types of power the wind owners already own
  - Identify potential companies to approach to fund
* Are there any trends in the wind turbine industry over time?
  - Analyze the wind turbine industry in the last few years
* I want to understand the locations that the wind turbines are in, and how that matches with population data
  - Analyze the demographics of the location of the wind turbines
  - Connect the data to the Census data in Tableau using the t_fips feature
* I want to better understand wind turbines so that I can make an informed decision on where to invest
  - How large are they?
  - Who are the manufacturers?
  - What is the capacity?
  - How large are the power plants?
  - Are there any manufacturers that require more maintenance than others?
* I want a recommendation on which wind turbine operators in the US market I should approach to invest in
* I want to know the dynamics of the Wind Turbine market in the US, so I can work out whether to invest in it
  - How strong is the wind power market in the US?
  - Is the wind power market a good market to be in?
* I want to see the locations and output power (capacity) of wind turbines across the USA
  - Map showing the current state of the US Wind Turbine market
  - Evolution of the US wind turbine market over time
* Who are the main players in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market for wind turbines in the USA?  How good are their turbines?
  - Who are the key players?
  - How does the quality of their equipment vary?
* What is the total capacity per equipment manufacturer (OEM) of wind turbines?
* How transferable is wind power that is generated? How far can it travel and still be useful?
  - Need to know when assessing operators
